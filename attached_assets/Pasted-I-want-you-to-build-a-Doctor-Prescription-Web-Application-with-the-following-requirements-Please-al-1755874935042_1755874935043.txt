I want you to build a Doctor Prescription Web Application with the following requirements. Please also provide a clear explanation of the project structure, along with step-by-step instructions to set up and run it on my local machine.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js + TailwindCSS (JavaScript only, no TypeScript)

Backend (Main App): Node.js + Express (JavaScript only, no TypeScript)

Database: MongoDB

AI Microservice: Python (FastAPI or Flask) for Speech-to-Text & NLP

Core Features

Authentication & Authorization

Secure login/signup for doctors.

Role-based access (doctor, admin).

Patient Management

Doctors can search, view, add, and edit patient profiles.

Store basic patient info & history in MongoDB.

Prescription Creation (AI-powered with voice input)

A record button to capture doctor’s voice.

Send audio to Python microservice for:

Speech-to-Text (use Whisper or any free open-source STT).

NLP processing to extract:

Medicines (name, dosage, frequency, duration).

Tests.

Send structured prescription back to Node.js.

Node.js generates a professional-looking PDF prescription (downloadable).

Dashboard / UI

Doctor dashboard with navigation.

Prescription history for each patient.

Clean Tailwind-based design.

Additional Features (Future Scope)

Conflicting drug warnings (detect unsafe medicine combinations).

Email prescription to patient (PDF attachment).

Doctor’s digital signature on PDF.

Analytics dashboard (patients count, prescriptions count, most common medicines/tests, etc.).

Voice commands for navigation.

Multi-language support for prescriptions.

Project Structure (Must be Explained Clearly)

Please generate the project with a modular, clean folder structure like this (or similar):

│   ├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies

└── README.md              # Clear setup & run instructions

Setup & Running (Must be Explained in README + Response)

Please clearly describe how to set up and run the project locally:

Clone repo & install dependencies

cd backend && npm install

cd frontend && npm install

cd ai-service && pip install -r requirements.txt

Run MongoDB locally (or connect to Atlas).

Start AI microservice

cd ai-service

python app.py

Start backend

cd backend

npm run dev

Start frontend

cd frontend

npm start

Visit frontend in browser (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

Important Notes

Keep everything in JavaScript only (no TypeScript).

Use MVC pattern for backend (controllers, routes, models separated).

Explain in detail how the Node backend talks to the Python microservice (via REST API calls).

Add comments in code for clarity.

Ensure the PDF prescriptions look professional (proper formatting).

👉 Please generate the entire project scaffold, including all folders/files, and give me a clear explanation of how it works.
